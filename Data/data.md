# Data Generation

- [ ] TODO: Define the PDE with all its constants, coeffeicnts and variables
- [ ] TODO: Code the BCs and ICs
- [ ] TODO: Generate Data and verify its accuracy/closeness with Zhang paper
- [ ] TODO: Plan DOE Strategy

# Code for Simulation

- [done] TODO: Generate model for the Thermal conductivity and plot it.
- [done] TODO: Generate model for the Specific Heat.
- [ ] TODO: Generate model for the Latent Heat.
- [done] TODO: Generate model for Density- assme that it will vary linearly with temperature

- [ ] TODO: Modify code of the PDE.
- [ ] TODO: Modify the Boundary conditions to include dirichlet conditions.

- [ ] TODO: Add a code for Cauchy or Neumann Condition to test the difference.

- [ ] TODO : Verify Results with Zhang et.al Paper.
