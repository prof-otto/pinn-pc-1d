# Data generation for the simulation

Objectives:-

1. Should depict the solidification of Casting realistically.
2. Should be able to predict defects using Niyama Criteria.
3. Should have clear information on the Equations used for the simulation.

Case Study:-

Solidification and Niyama prediction of a 1D Bar.


1. Identify the real world cases where shrinkage is generally found
2. In one such case , identify a 1D geometry.
3. Get a real world scenario where we know the material, process properties and the geenrated simulation can be compared to real world.

In case of casting and niyama criteria which is ration of temperature gradient in space (G) to time (R), shrinkage occurs when the G is less and R is more.
This happens when thickenss is more and heat flows quickly.
