# Data generation for the simulation

Objectives:-

1. Should depict the solidification of Casting realistically.
2. Should be able to predict defects using Niyama Criteria.
3. Should have clear information on the Equations used for the simulation.

Case Study:-

Solidification and Niyama prediction of a 1D Bar.


1. Identify the real world cases where shrinkage is generally found
2. In one such case , identify a 1D geometry.
3. Get a real world scenario where we know the material, process properties and the geenrated simulation can be compared to real world.

In case of casting and niyama criteria which is ration of temperature gradient in space (G) to time (R), shrinkage occurs when the G is less and R is more.
This happens when thickenss is more and heat flows quickly. 


Stages of data generation

1. Defining the problem case

    We want to simulate a case of HPDC and focus on soldification. 
    So we consider the stage when the material has filled the die under high pressure and then soldification happens.
    Here we have two die interfaces at the both ends.
         

2. Defining the PDE 
    The PDE consider is the transient heat conduction equation with the source term  embedded with the latent heat of freezing.
    The thermal conductivity,specific heat and latent heat changes with respect to temperature (Zhang et.al Paper)

    Overlead document has this PDE [Done]
    
## We are using FDD because it is simple 1D, for 3D with complex shapes we will need to use FEM/FVM  methods.

3. Defining the IC and BC conditions [Done]
    The initial condition is uniform temperature and pressure.
    The boundary condition is a temperature based on the zhang et.al paper.
    There are two metal molds at the left and right boundaries.

4. Selecting referenced Material conditions [Pending]
    The material considered here is Aluminium Alloy (A356) based on the Zhang et.al Paper.

Code Checklist for simulation development.

 1. 

5. Choosing the DOE [Pending]
    There are material and process parameters which is investigated for influence on the shrinakge generation.
    The material parameters are L_fusion, k, cp and Density at solid, liquid and intermediate mushy range
    The process parameters are initial temperature, boundary heat transfer coefficients.
    
6. Selecting the variation range[Pending]

7. Generating the Data based on DOE and storing it in a file/database.[Pending]
